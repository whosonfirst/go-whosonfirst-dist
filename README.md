# go-whosonfirst-dist

Go package for working with Who's On First distributions.

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` (specifically a version of Go more recent than 1.6 so let's just assume you need [Go 1.8](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher) and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.

## Important

This is work in progress. It's probably not worth trying to use yet unless you're me.

## What is a "distribution".

Things like the [SQLite](https://dist.whosonfirst.org/sqlite/) databases or the "[bundles](https://dist.whosonfirst.org/bundles/)".
