# go-whosonfirst-bundles

Go package for working with Who's On First data bundles

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` (specifically a version of Go more recent than 1.6 so let's just assume you need [Go 1.8](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher) and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.

## Important

This is work in progress that will eventually (soon, hopefully) be blessed as a
`1.0.0` release so we can test it with equally on-going work around the
[go-whosonfirst-dist](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-dist)
package.

(It is not possible to fetch a branch with `go get` because of the
affectionately named "stable HEAD philosophy" so here we are...)

Previous code has been snapshotted in a [0.9.0
release](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-bundles/releases/tag/0.9.0).

Apologies if this makes your life complicated. Documentation, etc. to follow shortly.
